illicits use for the variable AX12_HEXAPOD


Some variable stuff
makes the multiplier variable

sets the ripple gait speed to 1
sets the amble gait speed to 3
sets the tripod gait speed to 5

#ifdef means "if defined," and AX12_HEXAPOD is defined in line 12
sets the top speed of the bot to 10
#endif ends the "if defined" statement

AX18_HEXAPOD is not defined, therefore
top speed is not set to 12
end the if statement

starts setup statement
sets pin 0 to output data (whatever the heck is put in there)

sets up IK (Inverse Kinematics)
picks the amble gait

sets up the serial for Serial.print, etc.


waits a second
creates a voltage variable and sets it to the voltage running through the servos
v
These 3 lines print "System Voltage: [voltage] volts."
^
if the voltage is within the paramaters of less than 10 volts


stands up the hexapod

sets the multiplier to 3 (AMBLE_SPEED's value)

main loop executes


if there are commands to read (button inputs?)
then set pin 0 to the current value of ????

if R1 pressed
switch to the smooth ripple gait
set multiplier to 1

if R2 pressed
switch to the smooth amble gait
set multiplier to 3

if R3 pressed
switch to the ripple gait
set multiplier to 1

if L4 pressed
switch to the amble gait
set multiplier to 3

if L5 pressed
switch to the slower tripod gait
set multiplier to 5

if L6 pressed
switch to the faster tripod gait
set multiplier to 10


if walk-vertical > 40 or < -5 then //I'm assuming this is the left joystick up/down
set the forward speed to the multiplier * the input value / 2

otherwise

set the forward speed to 0


if walk-horizontal > 40 or < -35 then //I'm also assuming this is the left joystick, but left/right
set the sideways speed to the multiplier * the input value / 2

otherwise

set the horizontal speed to 0


if look-horizontal > 40 or < -40 then //I'm assuming this is the right joystick left/right (up/down do nothing?)
set the rotation speed to the negative value of the input / 100

otherwise

set the rotation speed to 0

This is for the aesthetic pleasure, but we're not gonna use it

if done, then
do the inverse kinematics function
some controller stuff



update joints??
