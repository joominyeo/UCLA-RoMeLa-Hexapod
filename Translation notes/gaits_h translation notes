define ik_req_t everywhere with the subvariables gaitGen and leg????
define void everywhere with the subvars gaitSetup and nothing????


//as of the first pass through, I don't quite know what these do yet
Creates "RIPPLE" and sets it to 0
creates "RIPPLE_SMOOTH" and sets it to 3
creates "AMBLE" and sets it to 4
creates "AMBLE_SMOOTH" and sets it to 5

creates "TRIPOD" and sets it to 6

any references to "MOVING" (e.g. "if MOVING") check if:
vertical speed > 5 or < -5 or
horizontal speed > 5 or < -5 or
rotational speed > .05 or < -.05

creates a standard transition variable, and since we have ax-12 servos it gets set to 98
